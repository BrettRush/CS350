# CS350
Module 8

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
Module 4's project was meant to teach you how to add an LCD screen to the breadboard of a raspbery pie so that later, a temputure and humidity sensor could be added and display info on the screen.

What did you do particularly well?
One thing I did well was being able to keep all the jumper cables organized for ease of use during the project. 

Where could you improve?
Where I could improve would be better integrating the LCD screen. At first, I installed the wrong packages and the LCD was unable to be detected, once this was corrected, I was able to fully integrate the LCD screen. 

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
One tool I'll be able to add will be better experience with statemachines and being able to create and troubleshoot them. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
The ability to configure the LCD screen transferred directly to the final project of CS350. 

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this project maintainable by keeping tabs on the many jumper cables so that if say one of the LED lights had to be relocated, Itd be possible with relative ease.
